# Generating Icons

All of the icon SVG components will end up in this folder when the `yarn icons:generate` command is ran. Be sure to run `yarn` to download the required devDependencies before running the command.

> `yarn dist` will automatically clear the icon files from this folder before generating new icon files and building.
